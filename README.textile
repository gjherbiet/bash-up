h1. bash-up: a versatile bash and environment setup utility

_bash-up_ is a collection of well-organized configuration files for your command-line environment and @bash@ configuration.

The objective of _bash-up_ is to provide a *unique* set of configuration files that you can deploy on as many computer as you like, whatever their system (as long as it is somewhat *NIX and @bash@ compliant).

h2. Principles

h3. Using @.profile@ and @.bashrc@ only as loaders of many many other files...

In the _bash-up_ approach, the @.profile@ and @.bashrc@ files don't so anything but _sourcing_ other configuration files in your _bash-up_ directory.

You will not declare *any* variable, alias or function in those two files.

*Why oh why ?* Let's read next section...

h3. A hierarchy of generic-to-specific files

All configuration files for _bash-up_ are organized by *sections* (e.g. _aliases_, _functions_, _completion_, etc.) so you can easily organize them.

For each section, files are *common* to all systems and all hosts (these are the files placed directly in a *section* directory), or *system-specific* (when placed in a *system* directory, e.g. _Linux_, _Darwin_ or whatever @uname -s@ may return), or *host-specific* (when placed in a *host* directory,
using the output of @hostname -s@ to determine the current machine).

Have a look at this example:

<pre>
bash-it/
|- aliases/
   |- aliases_one
   |- some_more
   |- Linux
   |  |- linux_aliases
   |- Darwin
      |- macosx_aliases
      |- machine_2/
      |  |- specific_aliases
      |  |- the_more_the_better
      |- machine_3/
         |- for_machine_3
</pre>

Consider me having three computers (_lucky me!_):
* @machine_1@, a good old desktop running Linux
* @machine_2@, a MacBook Pro running Mac OS X
* @machine_3@, an iMac running Mac OS X

The files @aliases_one@ and @some_more@ will apply to all three machines (these are the *common* files).

@linux_aliases@ will only apply to @machine_1@, as it is the only machine running Linux.

@macosx_aliases@ will apply to both @machine_2@ and @machine_3@ (as they run Mac OS X). @specific_aliases@ and @the_more_the_better@ will apply to @machine_2@ *only*, as *host-specific* files and @for_machine_3@ is naturally loaded only on @machine_3@.

Note that the actual name of the file doesn't matter, so *feel free to name them to whatever you think is relevant!*

Another good principle is that *don't fear to split your configuration in as many files as you want!*

h4. What if...

*What if, say @machine_2@ dual-boots on both Mac OS X and Linux ?*
Okay, create a @machine_3@ *host* directory under the @Linux@ *system* directory and create there *symbolic links* for all relevant configuration files.

*What if I want some more specific system discriminant, like the OS version or the distribution?*
Err,... I thought of it (hey, that's the proof!) but I'll work on it for future releases.
